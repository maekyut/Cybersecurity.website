					<h1> What is Cybersecurity</h1>
					<p><li>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks.</li></p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.</p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					<p><li>Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative.</li></p>

						<p><li><u>Malware Attacks</u> - is an abbreviation of “malicious software”, which includes viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, and ransomware,<br> and is the most common type of cyberattack. Malware infiltrates a system,usually via a link on an untrusted website or email<br> or an unwanted software download. It deploys on the target system, collects sensitive data, manipulates and blocks access<br> to network components, and maybrdestroy data or shut down the system altogether.<br></li></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><p>Here are some of the main types of malware attacks:</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

							<p><b>Viruses</b> is a piece of code injects itself into an application. When the application runs, the malicious code executes.
								Worms—malware that exploits software vulnerabilities and backdoors to gain access to an operating system. Once installed in the network, the worm can carry out attacks such as distributed denial of service (DDoS).</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								<p><b>Trojans</b> a malicious code or software that poses as an innocent program, hiding in apps, games or email attachments. An unsuspecting user downloads the trojan, allowing it to gain control of their device.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								<p><b>Ransomware</b> is a user or organization is denied access to their own systems or data via encryption. The attacker typically demands a ransom be paid in exchange for a decryption key to restore access, but there is no guarantee that paying the ransom will actually restore full access or functionality.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								<p><b>Cryptojacking </b>attackers deploy software on a victim’s device, and begin using their computing resources to generate cryptocurrency, without their knowledge. Affected systems can become slow and cryptojacking kits can affect system stability.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								<p><b>Spyware</b>a malicious actor gains access to an unsuspecting user’s data, including sensitive information such as passwords and payment details. Spyware can affect desktop browsers, mobile phones and desktop applications.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								<p><b>Adware</b>a user’s browsing activity is tracked to determine behavior patterns and interests, allowing advertisers to send the user targeted advertising. Adware is related to spyware but does not involve installing software on the user’s device and is not necessarily used for malicious purposes, but it can be used without the user’s consent and compromise their privacy.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								<p><b>Fileless malware </b>>no software is installed on the operating system. Native files like WMI and PowerShell are edited to enable malicious functions. This stealthy form of attack is difficult to detect (antivirus can’t identify it), because the compromised files are recognized as legitimate.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								<p><b>Rootkits</b> software is injected into applications, firmware, operating system kernels or hypervisors, providing remote administrative access to a computer. The attacker can start the operating system within a compromised environment, gain complete control of the computer and deliver additional malware.</p></li><br>
								<p><li><u>Social Engineering</u>-involves tricking users into providing an entry point for malware. The victim provides sensitive information or unwittingly installs malware on their device, because the attacker poses as a legitimate actor.<br></li></p><br><p>Here are some of the main types of social engineering attacks:</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								<p><b>Baiting</b> is the attacker lures a user into a social engineering trap, usually with a promise of something attractive like a free gift card. The victim provides sensitive information such as credentials to the attacker.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								<p><b>Pretexting</b> is similar to baiting, the attacker pressures the target into giving up information under false pretenses. This typically 	involves impersonating someone with authority, for example an IRS or police officer, whose position will compel the victim to comply.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								<p><b>Phishing</b> is the attacker sends emails pretending to come from a trusted source. Phishing often involves sending fraudulent emails to as many users as possible, but can also be more targeted. For example, “spear phishing” personalizes the email to target a specific user, while “whaling” takes this a step further by targeting high-value individuals such as CEOs.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								<p><b>Vishing </b>(voice phishing)is the imposter uses the phone to trick the target into disclosing sensitive data or grant access to the target system. Vishing typically targets older individuals but can be employed against anyone.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								<p><b>Smishing </b>(SMS phishing)the attacker uses text messages as the means of deceiving the victim.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								<p><b>Piggybacking</b> an authorized user provides physical access to another individual who “piggybacks” off the user’s credentials. For example, an employee may grant access to someone posing as a new employee who misplaced their credential card.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								<p><b>Tailgating</b> an unauthorized individual follows an authorized user into a location, for example by quickly slipping in through a protected door after the authorized user has opened it. This technique is similar to piggybacking except that the person being tailgated is unaware that they are being used by another individual.</p><br>
								<p><li><u>Supply Chain Attacks</u>-are a new type of threat to software developers and vendors. Its purpose is to infect legitimate applications and distribute malware via source code, build processes or software update mechanisms.
								Attackers are looking for non-secure network protocols, server infrastructure, and coding techniques, and use them to compromise build and update process, modify source code and hide malicious content.</li></p><br>
								<p>Types of supply chain attacks include:</p><br>
								<p>1.Compromise of build tools or development pipelines.</p>
								<p>2.Compromise of code signing procedures or developer accounts.</p>
								<p>3.Malicious code sent as automated updates to hardware or firmware components.</p>
								<p>4.Malicious code pre-installed on physical devices.</p><br>
								<p><li><u>A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack</u> involves intercepting the communication between two endpoints, such as a user and an application. The attacker can eavesdrop on the communication, steal sensitive data, and impersonate each party participating in the communication.</li></p><br>
								<p>Examples of MitM attacks include:</p><br>

								<p><b>Wi-Fi eavesdropping</b> an attacker sets up a Wi-Fi connection, posing as a legitimate actor, such as a business, that users may connect to. The fraudulent Wi-Fi allows the attacker to monitor the activity of connected users and intercept data such as payment card details and login credentials.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								<p><b>Email hijacking</b> an attacker spoofs the email address of a legitimate organization, such as a bank, and uses it to trick users into giving up sensitive information or transferring money to the attacker. The user follows instructions they think come from the bank but are actually from the attacker.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								<p><b>DNS spoofing </b>a Domain Name Server (DNS) is spoofed, directing a user to a malicious website posing as a legitimate site. The attacker may divert traffic from the legitimate site or steal the user’s credentials.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								<p><b>IP spoofing</b> an internet protocol (IP) address connects users to a specific website. An attacker can spoof an IP address to pose as a website and deceive users into thinking they are interacting with that website.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								<p><b>HTTPS spoofing</b> HTTPS is generally considered the more secure version of HTTP, but can also be used to trick the browser into thinking that a malicious website is safe. The attacker uses “HTTPS” in the URL to conceal the malicious nature of the website.</p><br>
								<p><li><u>A Denial-of-Service (DoS)</u> attack overloads the target system with a large volume of traffic, hindering the ability of the system to function normally. An attack involving multiple devices is known as a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.</p></li><br>
								<p>DoS attack techniques include:</p><br>

								<p><b>HTTP flood DDoS</b> the attacker uses HTTP requests that appear legitimate to overwhelm an application or web server. This technique does not require high bandwidth or malformed packets, and typically tries to force a target system to allocate as many resources as possible for each request.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								<p><b>SYN flood DDoS</b> initiating a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection sequence involves sending a SYN request that the host must respond to with a SYN-ACK that acknowledges the request, and then the requester must respond with an ACK. Attackers can exploit this sequence, tying up server resources, by sending SYN requests but not responding to the SYN-ACKs from the host.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								<p><b>UDP flood DDoS</b> a remote host is flooded with User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets sent to random ports. This technique forces the host to search for applications on the affected ports and respond with “Destination Unreachable” packets, which uses up the host resources.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><b>ICMP flood</b> a barrage of ICMP Echo Request packets overwhelms the target, consuming both inbound and outgoing bandwidth. The servers may try to respond to each request with an ICMP Echo Reply packet, but cannot keep up with the rate of requests, so the system slows down.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								<p><b>NTP amplification—Network Time Protocol (NTP)</b> servers are accessible to the public and can be exploited by an attacker to send large volumes of UDP traffic to a targeted server. This is considered an amplification attack due to the query-to-response ratio of 1:20 to 1:200, which allows an attacker to exploit open NTP servers to execute high-volume, high-bandwidth DDoS attacks.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

					<p> 4.Document your cybersecurity strategy.</p><br>
					<p>Developing and implementing a cybersecurity strategy is an ongoing process and will present many challenges. It's critically important that you monitor and reassess your organization's cybersecurity maturity periodically to measure the progress you're making -- or not making -- toward your objectives. The sooner you identify an area that's falling behind, the sooner you can address it and catch up. Measuring progress should include internal and external audits, tests and exercises that simulate what would happen under different circumstances, like a major ransomware incident.</p><br>
